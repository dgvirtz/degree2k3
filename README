These MAGMA files accompany Part 2 of the article "Quantitative arithmetic of diagonal degree 2 K3 surfaces" (arxiv:1910.06257).
The two main files that can be executed are:
- main3.magma, verifying the transcendental 3-torsion in Theorem 8.17
- main2.magma, verifying the transcendental 2-torsion in Theorem 8.18
The computation is faster if one only iterates over the nontrivial cases as precomputed in nontrivial2.magma and nontrivial3.magma.
